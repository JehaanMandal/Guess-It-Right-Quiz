## Guess-It-Right-Quiz
Created a Quiz Game where you can play the quiz by clicking on the "Start Quiz" button. Once you click the start quiz button the first question will pop-up on the screen with the options. You can select any one of the option and for the next question you have to click on "Next" button. The same process will go upto 15 questions where you have to select the answer of respective question. Although there is a option called "Previous" button where you can go back to previous question if you think you have guessed it wrong. And At the End you can see the answers and user can see what mistakes they did or how many answer they have guessed it right.
